Cyber-Healing AI is an innovative cybersecurity solution designed to detect, isolate, and mitigate threats in real-time using advanced AI techniques. Built for hackathon challenges like Sparkathon, this application combines a React.js-based frontend dashboard with a FastAPI backend to deliver a seamless user experience for network security monitoring. At its core, it leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to analyze encrypted network traffic flows, identifying anomalies with high accuracy, while a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent simulates adversarial scenarios to enhance threat detection robustness. The self-healing module autonomously isolates compromised systems and applies mitigation strategies, logging all activities in a SQLite database for auditability. Users can interact with the system through an intuitive interface, submitting scan requests, viewing detailed logs, and visualizing threat trends via interactive charts. Preprocessed datasets and synthetic adversarial traffic power the AI models, housed in a modular structure with Jupyter notebooks for experimentation. Whether deployed locally or on cloud platforms, Cyber-Healing AI offers a scalable, cutting-edge tool for proactive cyber defense, making it ideal for security researchers and IT teams aiming to stay ahead of evolving threats.
